# Diamond Intelligence Engine (DIE)
## Version 5.6 — First-Load Data Initialization Fix

Diamond Intelligence Engine (DIE) is a professional MLB analytics platform designed to combine live MLB data, advanced baseball metrics, historical tracking, and prediction intelligence into one clean, responsive web experience.

The long-term goal is to make DIE a centralized prediction engine for Home Run, Strikeout, Moneyline, and Over/Under analysis, with a Tracker that learns from completed predictions and improves future projections.

## Version 5.6 Changes

### First-Load Fixes
- Fixed **HRs Completed from Projection** so it no longer requires a page reload to populate correctly.
- Fixed **Pitcher Report** so it warms and populates correctly on first page load.
- Added a coordinated first-load bootstrap so key modules initialize in the correct order.
- Delayed the first live-score refresh until after all page modules are fully registered.
- Re-runs HR completion matching after HR Potential finishes loading so completed projected HRs can be detected immediately.

### Stability Improvements
- Reduced first-load race conditions between:
  - Live Scores
  - HRs Today
  - HR Potential
  - HRs Completed from Projection
  - Pitcher Report
  - K's Today
  - Tracker-dependent data
- Warm-loads Pitcher Report data in the background so opening the tab feels immediate.
- Preserves the Tracker tab layout and functionality.

## Diamond Intelligence Engine Vision

### Situational Intelligence
Planned factors include:
- Weather
- Ballpark factors
- Umpire tendencies
- Bullpen fatigue
- Lineup changes
